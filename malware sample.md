# Android malware datasets

List some android malware datasets in academic research.Some of them are still up to date.

> Some dataset information are collected from [traceflight/Android-Malware-Datasets](https://github.com/traceflight/Android-Malware-Datasets)

## [The Drebin Dataset](https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/index.html)
**Description:** The dataset contains 5,560 applications from 179 different malware families. The samples have been collected in the period of August 2010 to October 2012 and were made available to us by the MobileSandbox project. 

**Sample Volume:** 5,560 applications from 179 different malware families

**Collected Time:** 2010.8 - 2012.10

## [Android Malware Genome Project](http://www.malgenomeproject.org/)

> (2015/12/21) Due to limited resources and the situation that students involving in this project have graduated, **we decide to stop the efforts of malware dataset sharing**.

**Description:** In this project, we focus on the Android platform and aim to systematize or characterize existing Android malware. Particularly, with more than one year effort, we have managed to collect more than 1,200 malware samples that cover the majority of existing Android malware families, ranging from their debut in August 2010 to recent ones in October 2011.

**Sample Volume:** more than 1,200

**Collected Time:** 2010.8 - 2011.10

##  [VirusTotal Mobile Apps Samples](https://www.virustotal.com)

> VirusTotal: Analyze suspicious files and URLs to detect types of malware including viruses, worms, and trojans.

**Description:** VirusTotal can also be used through a smartphone app.   VirusTotal is about empowering the Community in order to build tools that will make the Internet a safer place, as such, we like to credit and feature Community-developed goodies that help the antivirus industry in receiving more files in order to have more visibility into threats. Below you can find links to apps that will allow you to interact with VirusTotal making use of your smartphone, note that these are not developed by VirusTotal itself and so we are not responsible for them.

**Sample Volume:** N/A

**Collected Time:** up to date

**HomePage:** https://www.virustotal.com

**Way to get:** 
1. If you need a **small volume** of sample, **login to VirusTotal and download manually**.
2. If you need a **large volume** of sample, **email to virusTotal for academic requests**. You can choose "access to the Academic API" or "access to a folder of malware"
